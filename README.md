## 👋 About Me  

I am an **Electrical Engineering student** passionate about **FPGA Design, RISC-V Architecture, and Embedded Systems**.  
Currently working on my **Final Year Project: Smart Healthcare Monitoring using RISC-V Core on FPGA (Basys 3 Artix-7)**, integrating biomedical sensors with a custom RISC-V processor for real-time health data processing.  

I’m skilled in **Verilog HDL**, **SystemVerilog**, **VHDL**, and **Embedded C**, with hands-on experience in **Vivado**, **QuestaSim**, **ModelSim**, and **MATLAB/Simulink**.  
My goal is to design efficient, scalable, and reliable hardware systems using open-source hardware methodologies.
